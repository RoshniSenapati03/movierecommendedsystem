# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Description

The Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based project that utilizes machine learning techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences. The system is built using Jupyter Notebook and includes data visualization and analysis components to enhance the recommendation process.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download and Install Anaconda

To get started, you need to have Anaconda installed on your system. Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment for Python and R. You can download and install it from the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

### 2. Install Required Libraries

After installing Anaconda, open a new Jupyter Notebook. You will need to import the following libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
You can install any misiing libraries using the following commands: 
```
conda install numpy pandas matplotlibÂ seaborn
```
### 3. Download Data Files

You will need the CSV files containing movies and ratings data. You can either download these files from the source provided or obtain them from Kaggle or any other website. Make sure the files are saved in your working directory.

### 4. Run the Code

Once you have the data files and the required libraries, you can run the Jupyter Notebook. To open and run the notebook, you can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any other code editor that supports Jupyter Notebooks.

### 5. Open in VS Code

To open the notebook in VS Code, make sure you have the Python extension installed. Open VS Code, navigate to the folder containing the notebook file, and open it. You can then run the code cells to execute the movie recommendation system.
